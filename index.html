      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p class="desc-text">I thrive on finding creative solutions to problems. I have developed skills to consistently produce a desired result, quickly, effectively and within production or budgetary constraints. Transitioning in to training I have
        honed my ability
        to understand the needs of an individual, or a group and provide a satisfying and empowering learning experience. Empowering and inspiring others, I continually learn and develop my own skills. I have an extensive knowledge of technology and
        software, with particular expertise in the Creative field and Apple technology. I am certified in all Apple Pro software.

        In my personal life I am keen aero-modeller, music fan. I am improving my skills in video and audio production, refreshing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as beginning to learn Swift.</p>

        <h3>Falling Over</h3>
        <p class="desc-text">With a lifelong inability to acknowledge my limitations I have been able to hone this skill. I am adept at falling over, or off of, almost anything whilst making the most noise and creating the most coommotion, but rarely
          causing injury or
          damage to anything other than my pride!</p>

        <h3>Model Aircraft</h3>
        <p class="desc-text">Having taken up aero-modelling a few years ago it quickly transformed in to a highly engaging past-time. Having graduated from my foam trainer (arguably it was more 'Gorilla Glue' than foam by the end of it's tenure), I
          quickly began to
          build, fly and inevitably crash balsa planes as well. Some of these I had made entirely from scratch.</p>

      <h2>Want To Talk?</h2>
      <h3>I can talk about most things, as long as it's not tech!</h3>
      <p>I can teach it, or use it to make something that is actually cool and useful, just don't expect me to espouse it.</p>
